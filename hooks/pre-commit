# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.

# Propagate failures:
set -euxo pipefail

# To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-commit".

# Build vendor/haskell/actions/setup/index.js:
(cd vendor/haskell/actions/setup && npm test && npm run bundle)

# Build dist/index.js:
npm run all

# Commit generated files:
git add dist/index.js
git add dist/index.js.map
