  # NOTE:
  #   The following inputs are taken from actions/haskell/setup, because
  #   haskell/actions/setup reads action.yml from `__dirname/../action.yml`,
  #   which resolves to wenkokke/setup-agda/action.yml when we use it.
  #   When haskell/actions/setup reads default values for ghc-version,
  #   cabal-version, and stack-version, this fails with:

  #   Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'default')
